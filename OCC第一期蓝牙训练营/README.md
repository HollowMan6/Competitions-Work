## 智能车管

现在车载蓝牙一般都只是用来听音乐和接电话的，并没有完全发挥出蓝牙的全部功能。

我觉得可以通过和车企的合作，开发出深度适配汽车的管理APP，基本功能在听音乐和接电话的基础上，还可以包括：

1. 使用APP启动车辆，免去钥匙忘带的烦恼。
2. 手机控制闪灯鸣笛，方便在车库中找车，同时在遇到异常情况时，比如有小偷或者危险情况，可以控制车辆进行威慑。
3. 使用APP查看汽车锁定状态，对车辆进行远程上锁和解锁，这样方便了总是忘锁车的车主，也方便了一些总不知道自己车锁没锁的用户，同时也方便了可能忘带车钥匙的车主。
4. 当APP检测到用户远离车辆一定距离，车还没锁时，会自动发出警报。
5. 使用APP可以在用车前提前启动空调，完美解决了汽车在外停放时冬冷夏热的尴尬局面，一上车就能感受到扑面而来的温暖或清凉。
6. 通过APP蓝牙链接查看汽车的数据，如查看总里程、剩余油量、平均百公里的油耗，掌握汽车的状态。
7. 汽车在检测到车辆的异常信息，比如可能发生了剐蹭，或者汽油即将耗尽，或是检测到了不安全行车因素，比如安全带没系好，车门没关好，或者锁车时车窗还开着的时候，都会自动通过蓝牙向手机APP报警，提醒用户注意。
8. 除了和车辆进行适配，APP还可以和停车场进行合作，通过蓝牙Mesh进行组网，方便停车位的管理，用户也可以通过APP进行停车位预约以及占用，释放。

建议：可以结合电动汽车进行创意的实现

# Open Chip Community 1st round Bluetooth Training Camp Idea Description

## Intelligent car management

Now the car Bluetooth is only used to listen to music and answer the phone, and it doesn't give full play to all the functions of Bluetooth.

I think we can develop a management app that is deeply suitable for cars through cooperation with car companies. The basic functions include listening to music and answering phone calls, and can also include:

1. Use app to start the vehicle to avoid the trouble of forgetting the key.

2. The mobile phone controls flashing lights and honking, which is convenient to find a car in the garage. At the same time, in case of abnormal circumstances, such as thieves or dangerous situations, the vehicle can be controlled to deter.

3. Use app to check the lock status of the car and lock and unlock the vehicle remotely, which is convenient for the owner who always forgets to lock the car, and it is also convenient for some users who always don't know whether their car is locked or not, and it is also convenient for owners who may forget to bring their car keys.

4. When app detects that the user is far away from the vehicle for a certain distance and the car is not locked, it will automatically send out an alarm.

5. The app can start the air conditioner in advance before using the car, which perfectly solves the embarrassing situation of cold winter and hot summer when the car is parked outside. You can feel the warmth or coolness as soon as you get on the car.

6. View the data of the car through the app Bluetooth link, such as the total mileage, remaining fuel, average fuel consumption of 100 km, and master the status of the car.

7. When the car detects abnormal information of the vehicle, such as the possibility of scratching, or the gasoline is about to run out, or unsafe driving factors are detected, such as the safety belt is not fastened, the door is not closed, or the window is still open when the car is locked, it will automatically alarm the mobile phone app through Bluetooth to remind the user to pay attention.

8. In addition to adapting to vehicles, app can also cooperate with parking lot, networking through Bluetooth mesh to facilitate parking management. Users can also reserve, occupy and release parking spaces through app.

Suggestion: we can combine the electric vehicle to realize the idea.
